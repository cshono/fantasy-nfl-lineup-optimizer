# Fantasy NFL Lineup Optimizer 

This project provides optimized fantasty football lineups for Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) Leagues such as Draft Kings or Fan Duel. Historical data is pulled from fantasydata.com to train a weekly fantasy projection model. These projections along with historical DFS salaries and scores are used to determine an optimal lineup of players for the coming week of NFL games. This information is then displayed via dashboard.
